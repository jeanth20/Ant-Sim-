This is an Ant Hole Simulation - a simple browser-based game where:

White ants move around collecting yellow food pieces that the player places by clicking
Ants return food to a green queen ant at the bottom of the screen
Each food piece delivered increases the score
The simulation uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering
Ants automatically seek the nearest food when not carrying anything
The game features a minimalist dark UI with a score counter
It's a basic interactive simulation demonstrating simple autonomous agent behavior.

Summary
I've successfully set up a FastAPI application with Jinja2 templates to run your HTML code. Here's what I did:

Created a project structure with the following files:
 app/main.py: The main FastAPI application
 app/templates/index.html: The HTML template
 app/static/: Directory for static files (CSS, JS, images)
 run.py: A script to run the application
Installed the required dependencies:
FastAPI: The web framework
Uvicorn: ASGI server to run the application
Jinja2: Template engine
Set up the FastAPI application with Jinja2 templates and static files support
Moved your HTML content to a template file
Started the application on http://127.0.0.1:8000
The application is now running and you can access it in your browser. The Ant Hole Simulation should be working as expected.

Additional Information
Hot Reloading: The application is configured with reload=True, so any changes you make to the code will automatically reload the server.
Static Files: If you want to separate your JavaScript and CSS into separate files, you can place them in the  app/static directory and reference them in your template.
API Endpoints: You can add more API endpoints to your FastAPI application by adding more route handlers in  app/main.py.
Documentation: FastAPI automatically generates API documentation. You can access it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Would you like me to explain any part of the setup in more detail or make any changes to the implementation?
